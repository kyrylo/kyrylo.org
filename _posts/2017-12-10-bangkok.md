I've got a strong idea: I need to spend these winter holidays in Asia, away from
the snow and cold weather. Bangkok's capital, Thailand, was perfect for that.
<img src="https://imgur.com/CQzQBCo.jpg">

As you may know, Thais speak almost no English. I've learned "sawadee ka" & "khop
kun krap". These won't get you anywhere, unfortunately.
<img src="https://imgur.com/tb6u8TD.jpg">

The Thai abugida (alphabet) allows some nice tricks with it. The word is written
with ropes. Can you imagine the same for English?
<img src="https://imgur.com/QJHnDQ5.jpg">

Even though it's hard to navigate without knowing the language, a lot of
touristy places do have signs in English.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/dvNLtPC.jpg">

Thailand cares about tourists a little bit more than your average city. They
even know what you typically would like to buy and provide you a "Tourist choice".
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/BseMNk6.jpg">

The MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transit) is the fastest way to get from point A to
point B. However, be aware that the staff won't let you bring your favourite
durian on the train.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/qPHTbcU.jpg">

Along with the MRT, Bangkok offers a developed bus network. There are caveats,
though. Some bus stops are hard to find. A lot of them don't provide any
information about routes. Additionally, I was never able to figure out the fare:
sometimes you pay per station, sometimes the price is fixed. It was very hard to
make any sense of it.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/xtpYEGk.jpg">

I have to admit, I was very impressed with the friendliness of Thai people. In
the vast majority of cases where I needed help and asked a Thai person, they
were nice to me. So if you are on a bus and don't know where to go, don't
worry, someone will help you out if you ask.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/rhSszld.jpg">

Having said that, be mindful of tuk-tuk drivers, because those people are not
nice. Every time I wanted to try a tuk-tuk, the driver's offered price was
higher than Uber's. Yes, they look flashy and cool, but their goal is to rip you
off.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/p528jHA.jpg">

In a way, tuk-tuk is the jeepney of the Philippines (except that jeepney drivers
don't rip you off): they are ubiquitous.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/lzywkzl.jpg">

Another viable choice to navigate the city is a plain old taxi cab. Quite often
they are even cheaper than Uber or Grab. Those guys also want to look gaudy.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/mjWR2zG.jpg">

It's interesting that every cab has information about the driver. It
provides some kind of safety in case they lock you in the car and decide to
murder you.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/r1MRFin.jpg">

Speaking of Uber, in Bangkok you can book UberMOTO. So, instead of cars you actually
book motorcycles. I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it makes a lot of
sense to me, because look at this damn traffic.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/cqoXJm9.jpg">

Finally, you can always cycle. The prevalent majority of cyclicsts use
small-wheel bicycles. I don't know why but maybe because they need to maneuver
between cars?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/v98Puvo.jpg">

Bike lanes do exist, but they are super rare.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/ZlufjSB.jpg">

As for me, I was a pedestrian.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/gB4Jror.jpg">

The life of a pedestrian in Bangkok is full of adventures. When I attempted to
cross a road, I had to wait for 15 minutes. Not only the traffic is heavy but
the average speed of a lane is so high that you have to run to survive.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/gfWgSHT.jpg">

Quite often traffic lights are absent (or not working) and the car flow is
constant so pedestrians are blocked. You can really wait for 10 minutes. It's
not an exaggeration.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/MWoQwIJ.jpg">

There are police stations here and there but I don't think they're in control
of the road situation at all.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/fUT2Tmr.jpg">

Sometimes, traffic guards help out.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/9nJ8buI.jpg">

One other threat that pedestrians have to deal with is rats (squint your eyes,
the rat is in the middle of the photo).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/AZ8AQUV.jpg">

The bad smell from trash lying on the sidewalks attracts them.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/uFSggiF.jpg">

Being an observant pedestrian, I couldn't miss an opportunity to take a picture
of someone who parks their car like an asshole. At that moment, I felt like I was
home.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/YJVOCIH.jpg">

A solar powered sign. I have a few questions. Why is it off? Does it only work
when the sun is up? Why is that so? You actually need them during the night, when
there's no sun.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/hUYrcLe.jpg">

The LEDs on the ground are supposed to alarm drivers of the bridge.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/k7xmSVD.jpg">

Now, let's get back to tourists. Bangkok is full of them.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/gHKt9w7.jpg">

I guess these guards hate them. Once in a while some cheeky bastard takes a
picture with them without their consent.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/aenu0Ey.jpg">

Tourists visit nothing but touristy places so it's easy to avoid
them. This pathway is in 50 meters from Khao San Road (a super busy street), and
there's not a single person but me.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/SNn8B1K.jpg">

While I'm standing there, the Khao San Road crowd feasts on insects.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/vAqegWc.jpg">

"Wai!" says Ronald McDonald.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/QmvRDJG.jpg">

"Ni hao" replies Mao and his friend.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/vqR4fl7.jpg">

I like how nature and urbanism meet each other in Bangkok. Someone is feeding
squirrels.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/XpFjToo.jpg">

Someone is feeding pigeons.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/l0BFHcp.jpg">

With the exception of _the_ pigeon. "Don't feed the pigeon" says the sign.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/AKMWCYz.jpg">

Nobody is risking to feed freaking monitor lizards, though.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/1mUs5rd.jpg">

A leaky faucet is a problem.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/UCubggb.jpg">

But a leaky pipe is fine.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/HyIcEoa.jpg">

Speaking of pipes, Thailand is probably the second country on Earth where you
can buy pipes for smoking drugs just on the street. The first one is likely
Afghanistan.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/NhEwkEk.jpg">

Thailand loves massage. Not only you can be massaged by real people...
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/D7RvKHH.jpg">

...but also by machines!
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/eOJQEBb.jpg">

You can also check the weight of your luggage (or yourself for that matter).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/QTX1Dzk.jpg">

Speaking of religion, as you know Thailand is a Buddhist country. At first, it was cool
going to a wat (temple), but it became repetitive very quickly. The
thing I noticed in Thailand is that they like to beg for money.

You are supposed to donate to monks.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/E9KRRBK.jpg">

Donate to Buddha.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/7UnfeRi.jpg">

Donate to the bear.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/siq6DPz.jpg">

Donate, donate, donate! Donate to this urinal!
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/7Y7qTgi.jpg">

Just don't lose your head in this donation carnival.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/fnPPAGE.jpg">

There are so many places to donate to that it's no wonder thievery is
flourishing.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/UUtwEWf.jpg">

However, I think donating gold would be better because buddhists love gold.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/6jCDbzE.jpg">

Thailand is a very weird country in regards to strictness. You are supposed to
take off your shoes upon entering a temple, wear proper clothes, stand up at the
cinema when they show some propaganda about their king prior to a film, but at
the same time you get ladyboys, hookers, pipes being sold on the street and
these wrist bands: the "Long live the King" band neighbours with "Mad cunt".
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/AURGEOJ.jpg">

My face after reading the whole board.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" src="https://imgur.com/GMDVXIb.jpg">

Speaking of the king, they have a serious propaganda there. The king is
everywhere. He's in schools.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/9eBnVW7.jpg">

In hospitals.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/L2cULPF.jpg">

Even on money.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/zxmQa7j.jpg">

All over the city there are people playing some sort of propaganda.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/Vqv5kau.jpg">

Desipte that, to my surprise, muslims also exist in Thailand. The "Muslim prayer
room" sign.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/QdzUYac.jpg">

Once in a while there will be a random monk on the street doing their chores
like topping up. They use the same streets as we, commoners, do.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/HK2I0bT.jpg">

The most authentic Armani suits in Thailand (no).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/Ysm95nu.jpg">

In Thailand people can still use payphones.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/2IzBbEX.jpg">

A key holder at a bus stop without any keys. I wonder if bus drivers leave their keys
there because I don't mind driving a bus. Imagine a buspooling service. Cool, huh?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/n1elRtC.jpg">

Free mobile charger stand.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/HdEwL1d.jpg">

A lot of Thai signs are amusing. Sometimes they're polite. "Please don't touch"
(an old exhibit).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/RrJL04N.jpg">

Yet, in the same room there's a sign, which says "Don't you dare
to mask the air conditioner".
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/zbjrkjO.jpg">

"Caution! Wet floor". That's really "helpful".
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/J0CwCgg.jpg">

Water canals (called khlongs) pierce the flesh of the city all over.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/Zi4lVGt.jpg">

Floating 7-eleven in a khlong.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/PX8oYvj.jpg">

In case of flooding or heavy rain the water will naturally flow inside these
channels. Make sure to have matches to send them down the stream.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/AhelIxl.jpg">

Hua Lamphong railway station strongly reminded me of [Kharkiv Railway
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_railway_station).

While exploring Bangkok sometimes I felt like Lara Croft.

Stunning work of the ancients (spoiler alert: it's actually modern).

I asked these guys to pose for me...

I'd like to remind the reader that I was there on Christmas
time. The fact that it's Christmas is barely reflected on the
streets.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://imgur.com/xaVUFqL.jpg">

New Year fireworks lasted only 5 minutes.

Nevertheless, Happy New Year 2018!
