I'm a forward-thinking person. Instead of looking back, I prefer to look
forward. Looking back means celebrating successes, mourning failures,
or maybe even learning from mistakes. Besides, I have a bad memory these days
because LLMs do all the thinking for me. So why not just look ahead and anticipate?
Anticipation is what drives us forward.

2026 is going to be the best year for me since I [embarked on an indie
dev journey][1]. I'll keep building [Telebugs][2], which has become quite
mature by now. I'm not done with it (there are still a few big epics ahead),
but overall, the product is rock solid.

The thing I'm most excited about, though, is a little announcement...
Since [I'm back to open source][3], I want to make 2026 the year of open source.

## Announcement

Announcing [Telesink][4]! Telesink will be an open-source, real-time
event tracking tool that acts as an informational heartbeat for your business,
so you can see what's happening _right now_.

You’ll be able to hook up your projects and watch live events like:

- “People are signing up”
- “Payments are flowing”
- “MRR is ticking up”
- “New trials are starting”
- “Users are completing onboarding”
- “Form submissions are coming in”
- “Subscribers are renewing”
- ...and many more.

Unlike analytical tools that dig into historical data or developer metrics,
Telesink is simple and real-time-first. It's built for everyone, a straightforward,
all-around dashboard for seeing things happen _as they happen_.

It's a cleaner replacement for those read-only bots in _Slack_, _Discord_, or
_Telegram_ that handle this kind of monitoring as an afterthought.

I've been thinking about this for months, and it grew directly out of my own
need to better understand what's happening in my [projects][5] (beyond just
errors).

It'll be **open source and free to self-host**, with a paid SaaS offering to
sustain development.

Right now I have nothing but the idea in my head (it's been simmering there
for months). I don't have all the answers or solutions yet, and honestly it's
scary because there are a lot of unknowns, but I'm ready to start.

I'll be building this in public. [Follow along][6]! I'm looking forward to
having you with me.
