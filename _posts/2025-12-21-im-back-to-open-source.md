If you’ve ever worked with Ruby, chances are you’ve used my code. I started my
programming journey by [contributing to open source](/programming/ruby/2013/04/12/so-what-is-binding-pry-exactly.html). Helping others and building software has been my passion from day one. In recent years, I paused publishing
my own projects to focus on commercial software. But I’ve dearly missed the
hacker spirit of open source.

Christmas is special for all Rubyists thanks to the annual Ruby release, so I
decided to tag along and join the Xmas party.

So here’s the announcement: [WeUseRails.com](https://weuserails.com) goes open
source! I launched it a year ago, and since then it has received over 150
submissions. It’s a free directory of Ruby on Rails web apps. Released under
AGPL-3.0, it ensures that it’s truly open source.

This is [my humble contribution](https://github.com/kyrylo/weuserails.com) to
the ecosystem. Enjoy!
