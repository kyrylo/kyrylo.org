      Hey there 👋
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm Kyrylo Silin, and I've had my fair share of ups and downs in the
      professional world. Getting laid off not once, but twice in the first half of
      2023 was a wakeup call 📞😰. It made me realize that I want to be the captain of my
      own ship.
    </p>

    <p>
      For over a decade, I've been immersed in the world of Ruby programming. It's not
      just a skill for me, it's a passion that's been brewing for years. I want to put
      out as many products as I can until something clicks and starts making waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not knee-deep in Ruby code, you'll find me exploring new corners of
      the world. My wife, a native of the Philippines 🇵🇭, has opened my eyes to the
      wonders of her homeland. I've even managed to pick up a bit of Tagalog and
      Cebuano along the way.
    </p>

      I'd be thrilled if you joined me on this journey!
