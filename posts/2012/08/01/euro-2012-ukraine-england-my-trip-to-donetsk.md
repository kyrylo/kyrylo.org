Euro 2012. Ukraine â€“ England. My trip to Donetsk
================================================

<time datetime="2012-08-01">August 1&ndash;2, 2012</time>

I was lucky to visit Donetsk on the 19th of June. I went to a Euro 2012 football
match between the Ukrainian and the English national football teams. I went to
the match with Kyrylo (namesake), a friend of mine.

## Day 1. The match

A trip between Kharkiv and Donetsk takes about three and a half hours by
train. We used a modern train officially called HRCS2, unofficially also known
as "Hyundai".

I wasn't impressed by Donetsk. The first scene you see when you leave the
Donetsk railway station is an ugly market.

It's interesting that almost all the banners are in Russian language, while in
my city they are all mostly in Ukrainian.

We found a hostel that we had planned to rent for 1 day. The hostel was a
decrepit old building with a bad smell inside.

Such a lovely view in the backyard.

Well, the good news is that the rent of a "luxurious" room with a broken TV-set
and a flying fly costed us only 5 euro.

Waiting for the receptionist to bring us the keys from our room, watching a soap
opera.

Got the keys. Kyrylo is trying to fix the TV-set (why on Earth? We didn't even
watch it).

After we moved in, we decided to go to the Donbas Arena stadium and check it
out. We've also got a couple of maps of Donetsk at a Euro 2012 help booth.

A tram was the most optimal choice.

On our way to Donbas Arena we've been feasting our eyes on the miners'
land. Donetsk felt like a huge village. The streets were grim. The atmosphere
was depressing. There were almost no buildings. Only a lot of grass and trees.

However, the stadium and its surroundings deeply impressed me. The lawn was
accurately shaved, the flowers pleasingly blossomed and the fountains were
merrily splashing water.

I have a hunch that Shakhtar's brazilians live inside those blue containers. Why
not, it's not far from the stadium.

We had 10 spare hours before the match so we figured that it would be nice to
eat something. We visited some restaruant with delicious food. After the
breakfast we decided to visit so-called fan zone. Since we had football tickets,
all public transport was free for us. We took a bus. The fan zone was in a park
in a couple of kilometers from the restaurant.

This bridge connects the park with the rest of the city.

It was really hot outside. I haven't had a cap, so it was really necessary to
cool my head down.

The fan zone was quite big. As big as it was boring there. So the only fun thing
was to take pictures.

To take pictures with some guys promoting Carlsberg.

Or take pictures with Englishmen.

Englishmen were extremely popular at that day. Everyone wanted to have a photo
with them, so there was a queue. The Englishmen were happy about that, too. If
you ask me, I don't quite understand the hype. Why would you want to take photos
of some random men?

Our guys were unpopular at that day. No-one wanted to take pictures with them.

<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D0GK35Q.jpg"/></noscript>

Out of thin air a man approached us. He wanted to take a picture of me and
Kyrylo and send it to my email. No idea why he wanted that, but he didn't send
us anything.

Meanwhile some people appeared on the stage and started dancing.

The match was going to start soon.

We met a few more Englishmen. They were pretty drunk.

One of the guys said that the English fans will be louder than the whole
stadium of Ukrainians. I said that that was the biggest bollocks I've ever heard.
However, he didn't lie. They were louder.

The fan zone was nice, but we were running late for the match. So, we had to go.
We wanted to pee and the loo was very close.

Finally, we are at the stadium. Donbas Arena is amazing. We managed to be in
time.

I was really impressed by the atmosphere.
There were many empty seats. Unfortunately, the tickets were expensive, so
probably not everyone could afford them.

It was the last game of Andriy Shevchenko, our best footballer. When I was at
the stadium, it seemed to me that we were immensely loud. But when I watched a
TV recording of this game, it turned out we were relatively silent. Illusion at
its best.

Ukraine lost the game and didn't qualify to the next round, so everyone was
upset. Initially we wanted to return to the fan zone after the match, but then
we decided to go to the hostel and have some rest.

## Day 2. Aftermatch

On the next day we had our train at 19:00, and we woke up around 11:00. We had
plenty of time to explore the city. It was almost lunch time and we could
eat a whole elephant. I suggested to visit the same restaurant we've been at on
day one, but Kyrylo wanted to visit McDonald's. I didn't really want to eat
there, so we decided that I eat first and then we go to McD's. While I was
eating, Kyrylo explored more of the city.

Donetsk is known for its mafia and we were constantly joking about it. However,
it probably exists. When I finished eating, walked outside and started waiting
for Kyrylo, I accidentally became involved in someone's conflict. I appeared
straight in the centre of it. According to the media, some random guy wanted to
kill another "big guy" with a screwdriver. I think this is lies, but
whatever. You can
[read about it](http://podrobnosti.ua/criminal/2012/06/21/843068.html) in
Russian.

### Afterlunch

We figured that we want to explore the centre of the city. It turned out that
the area nearby Donbas Arena isn't the centre at all. However, a McDonald's,
where Kyrylo had his lunch was.

Donetsk has a cool boulevard. They made it cool specifically for Euro 2012.
We've been wandering there and then came to a park. The park is very beautiful
and large, containing multiple sections. One disappointing thing about it was
that there was lots of ads of McD's.

Kyrylo is trying not to cry because of the defeat of our team (in reality this
is a good illustration for children books for the term "hangover").
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qenNj2P.jpg"/>
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qenNj2P.jpg"/></noscript>

It was time to go to the railway station. We took a bus with a crazy driver. It
looked like he forgot to turn his iron off in his apartment, so he was rushing
like a madman to turn it off.

The good thing was that we were on time. Goodbye, Donetsk.

The centre of Donestk is much better than the centre of Kharkiv, but my city is
better in general. I can't say that I enjoyed Donetsk, but I cannot say I didn't
either.

I'm happy that I participated in Euro 2012.
