Why I am not a fan of Google Analytics

[Google Analytics][ga] is a tool developed by Google, which allows web site
owners to embed it on their pages and collect various information about their
users, view a bunch of charts based on the collected data and see the various
reports. That is, Google Analytics aims to provide exemplary statistics about
the visitors of your site. Beyond doubt, it’s a fantastic tool to help to rule
your business. Anyway, I bet you’ve already heard of it. That was a description
for developers.

Now, let me reintroduce Google Analytics (GA), and I’ll be honest this time.

So, Google Analytics allows web site developers to track your actions on the web
pages you use. That is, GA allows big bosses to spy on you. Never heard of it?
By the way, do you know you use GA every day? Have you been a happy customer?
That was a description for everyone else.

The problem
-----------

Let’s imagine that you were teleported to a mysterious dark room with a
table-lamp and a computer (since GA is the culprit, you could imagine you’re in
a basement of Google Labs somewhere in the spacious desert of Texas). You
figured it’s boring there and decided to use the computer and read some
news. You opened a web browser and visited your favourite web site. Before
loading the web site’s content, the browser asks you a simple question: “Do you
want to enable tracking of your activity while staying on this site?
(Yes/No)”. What is your answer? Think about it duly. Do you think the grimy grim
man in black behind you would be happy to see you choosing “No” (you haven’t
spotted him initially, because he was under the veil of mystery and basement
darkness)?  Righto, let’s suppose, your answer was “Yes” (or most likely “I
don’t care”, which means the same). The web site content was very interesting
and you’ve spent 2 hours reading it. So after you’ve finished reading, you
closed the tab. But before closing, the browser demands you to answer one last
time: “Do you want to send the activity we just recorded to our servers?
(Yes/No)”. This activity is data generated by you while browsing the content:
your actions and behaviour while working with input devices of the
computer. Hence, it’s _your_ data they want to send, which belongs only to
_you_. Do you usually share your stuff with strangers? Me neither. I think it’s
clear now that no-one wants to share their data without permission.

Let’s teleport back to where you were. Oh, hello! You’re in a comfortable roomy
room now. There’s a computer in the room, of course (your computer this
time). Why not spend another couple of hours reading comics and other funny
stuff? No sooner said than done. You visit a web site with comics and suddenly
your browser asks the same questions you saw while in the
basement. There’s no suspicious men around this time. You safely answer “No”
on every question it asks. So, you finished using the computer, but the day is
not over yet and there’s still time left on your hands. With that being said,
you decide let’s go for a… but wait for a second, did you notice something
strange? When you’re free to choose, you usually want to stay private.

Of course, as I previously mentioned, you may not care. Privacy may not be your
concern if it doesn’t touch upon you directly. However, how do you like this:
every user on the internet, if he knows your email, _phone_, username or full
name, can find your Facebook account without asking you for a link. Just
navigate to [the special page][fb] and enter a random number from your phone
book. You’d be surprised, but you can easily find an unknown person who rang you
last month from a number that is not stored on phone and called you a
moron. Now, imagine that Google knows everything about you. It knows everything
about me, too. I use GMail, Android and Chrome _a lot_. Google Analytics seems
to be a “logical” addition to that soup, so they could spy on every level of
your internet activity.

How to protect yourself from Google Analytics
---------------------------------------------

Whether you use GMail, Android, Chrome or not it is your personal choice. You
can easily opt-out from using those products. On the contrary, Google Analytics is
everywhere and it’s free. It means that GA can be added to every web site,
including the web site of your dog. Because GA executes on the client side, the
best protection would be to disable JavaScript (JS) in your browser. As an additional
bonus, you will also block any other possible tracking activity (GA is not the
only malicious script, but the most ubiquitous). I don’t recommend to go this
way, though. Although you will be well protected and your pages will start
loading almost instantly, most likely you will encounter some issues. The
problem is that the modern web is covered in a plaid of JS. You will not be able
to browse some web sites and some features previously known to work before can
become unresponsive. JS is the most popular programming language and it is
becoming more and more popular, so your browsing experience will be even worse
in a couple of years.

There’s another option: [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on][gaoba]. Go
visit the page. You’ll discover that you are on Google.com. I haven’t used their
add-on, but I believe it’s bullshit. How can you trust an add-on from the same
company that spies on you? Yet another option is to use yet another extension by
a different company. Check out [Ghostery][ghostery]. I prefer this option,
because it can block many other tracking scripts. However, while writing this
article, I discovered it’s not open source. It means that only goodness knows
what their extension does with my data. I’m not aware of a similar open source
tool, though. Still, I find this extension the lesser of two evils. If you are
hardcore, you can develop your own way to cut out unwanted scripts. The
community will hug you tightly and thank you warmly.

You still may not want to use any protection, and you know what? I can
understand your choice. But it’s important to keep in mind that sometimes they
spy on you without your will, even when you don’t expect it. My advice to
everyone: choose wisely what you share with unknown people and random web sites.

Wrapping up

Every thing in our world has shortcomings and Google Analytics is no
exception. However, in case of GA the shortcoming is fatal: it is its main
feature. You don’t even have to register a Google account to be tracked by
them. As of 2012, [55% of the top 10,000 web sites][techcrunch] on the internet
use GA. I, as a programmer, am truly impressed by GA. It’s a really magnificent and
successful product. I, as a user, strongly dislike it. It’s the plague. I
respect big web sites like Wikipedia that [do not use GA][wikipedia]. I
encourage you to respect the users of your web site as well and forget about GA
or similar tools forever. Honor your users, because they are what make you
successful.

Did you know?
-------------

Did you know that Google Analytics is not the only product that violates your
privacy? There’s a Russian clone of GA called [Yandex.Metrica][metrica]. It is a
very popular service in Runet[^1].
Some web sites even use both GA and Metrica on the same web site.
