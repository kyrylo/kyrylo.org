Internship in San Francisco
===========================

<time datetime="2014-07-11">July 11, 2014 &hellip; September 24</time>

During my internship at Bugsnag I took some pictures of the city. My bicycle was
my companion. I cycled through many neighbourhoods of San Francisco and even
managed to cycle to neighbouring towns. The quality of the photos isn't
astonishing. My second companion was my Chinese smartphone. That's why.

The hotel I temporarily settled in was the first hotel I have ever visited.

Bathroom.

Bugsnag's office was very snug and cosy. In fact, when I showed the photo to my
parents, they confused it with a flat.

When I moved from the hotel to a studio apartment, I was lucky to have a
laundromat in my building. It saved me many hours. It is the best invention
of humanity.

Bugsnag's office is near the UN Plaza. Lots of birds and homeless people nearby.
Once upon a time I stepped on some American chewing gum. It is of very good
quality (curse them).

It is a noisy place, though. The traffic is very dense.

Although I'd never been to San Francisco before, it felt like I had. Thanks,
GTA!

The IT is real here. Once upon a time I had a project that required integration
with Salesforce. Those were grim days. To my surprise, I found the headquarters
of hell on Earth.

Tourists are quite common in this city.

It was always hard to keep track of which litter is recyclable and which is not.
SF is obsessed with it. An interesting observation: foundations of urns are
the same, but the top is like a cap and it's possible to replace it.

The public transportation system is incredibly advanced. You can take trams,
trolleybuses, buses, trains and taxis. The buses and the trolleybuses have a rack
in front of them, so you could mount bicycles on them.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Qw0bucE.jpg"/>
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qw0bucE.jpg"/></noscript>

The trams look and in fact are old-school. It's funny, but they're quieter than
our [Tatras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_T3).

The city is perfect for cycling. It has enormous hills to train your legs.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ODYvlSF.jpg"/>

There are lots of places you can park your bicycle throughout the city. Even
benches welcome cyclists.

There are a lot of parking lots. But they're all empty during the night. I think
cars dislike the moon and they all hide underground. A lot of buildings include
parking lots in their basements. Some buildings are built specifically for
parking.

The whole embankment is filled with interesting objects. For example, the
traffic lights by this building are synced. It's really hypnotising, when the
colour switches.

"The roof is on fire" saying is all about San Francisco. I've never seen so many
fire trucks in my life. The city burns every day. It's almost guaranteed that
you will hear the siren of a fire truck at least once a day.

Something that no tourist agency will tell you is that there are a lot of
homeless and bonkers people on the streets.

Speaking of the homeless, it wouldn't be fair if I didn't contrast them with the
rich. From what I read the gap between them is substantial. The contrast can
be observed with the naked eye.

There's a common abbreviation for "crossing" that played a trick on me. It
