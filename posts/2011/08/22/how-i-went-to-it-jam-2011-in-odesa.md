How I went to IT Jam 2011 in Odesa
==================================

<time datetime="2011-08-22">Aug 22, 2011</time>

I would like to say sorry in advance for the poor quality of the photos,
inadvertent canted angles and other possible bloopers. To begin with, I don't
have the skill to take good quality photos. Secondly, I haven't had any
experience with the photo camera I brought with me (as the result, I had no idea
how to configure it). Thirdly, the photo camera leaves a lot to be desired. An
important notice: it's better to prepare a cup or two of your favourite drink
before reading this, because it's a long story.

## Preamble. Kharkiv

One fine evening a fellow student, Serhii, rang me and offered a serious deal:
he wanted to visit a conference for software developers and people who work in the IT
sector. Without even thinking I immediately responded with a strong consent: we
are going there. My reasoning was simple: I have never ever been to a conference
and I wanted to discover what it's like. I was going there not for the sake of
acquiring some special knowledge, but for the sake of new feelings. Because I
think that the benefits from watching a talk remain the same no matter how you
consume information, either through a video or from a live performance. So, our
group consisted of four people. Each of us needed to register his email on the
conference's website. We also needed to buy two-way train tickets. The
conference itself was completely free, so each student could afford it.

It's high time to depature. Goodbye, Kharkiv!

## Odesa

I've been to Odesa before once, but in transit. Me and my football team were
travelling to Illichivsk, to a training camp. At the Odesa train station, we have
been packed in a tiny yellow bus, so I didn't remember anything about the city,
because my only concern was how to survive inside the bus.

We arrived in Odesa at half past eight in the morning. The weather was
magnificent: not too warm and not too cold. We've had two spare hours before the
conference's opening. We've decided to walk around the city and to find a
breakfast place.

The place where the conference had been taking place, the sea station, was in a
walking distance from the train station (where we was). Suddenly, out of thin
air a man with keys in his hand approached to us, while we were exploring the
map. He offered to pick up us. Apparently, he was an illegal taxi driver, so we
refused from his help.

It's worth mentioning that our path passed through the most famous street of
Odesa, Deribasivska St. We also passed through a similar by its look street
called Pushkinska St. When we were passing by more or less important buildings
we joked that we should visit all those dubious places instead of the
conference.

As a result of a mental unspoken voting we agreed on the best place for
breakfast, which was McDonald's. It's fast and convenient in our situation. I'm
not a frequent visitor of this restaurant, so I always prefer to order the Big
Mac menu. Unfortunately, the McD's people didn't have it, because it is not
included in the McD's breakfast menu. The choice was hard, so I ordered some
fancy omelette with latte. It was the first time when I tasted this drink.

Having finished our breakfast feast, we had exactly the minimal needed amount of
time to get to the sea port in time. At first glance the streets of Odesa were
empty. But when we reached the Potemkin Stairs everything fell into place.

It's still not too late to jump into a wagon and ride home.

On the plaza at the sea station there was a fountain with a levitating
tap. Serhii has shared the secret of the levitation with the rest of us.

Nearby there was a monument with an egg and a well-built toddler inside it. Not
impressive. I wasn't even impressed by old cannons with cannonballs lying next
to them, by many yachts and ships, by shipyards... What did impress me was the size
of the queue.

Wow... Quite a queue.

The ship's name is Amerigo Vespucci. It was built by Italians in 1931. Used by
Ukrainians in 2011.

## At the conference

Having finished our walk, we finally went to the conference. We needed to sign
up. I immediately was pleasantly astonished by the great number of women at the
conference. One interesting thing about the conference was that they had free
food such as various kinds of cookies, tea, coffee, water, sandwiches. Needless
to say the food was eaten very fast.

There were many people to sign up.

It was a good idea to have a snack before the opening. The ones who weren't
hungry could read various information about the conference.

## About the conference

I need to pause for a while and tell you about the conference on the whole. The
conference consisted of 42 talks. Each talk was 30 minutes long and the break
between the talks was 10 minutes long. The talks were divided by topics: mobile
technologies, Java, web-development, .NET, Quality Assurance and General
(various topics). So every 40 minutes, between 11:10 AM and 15:40 PM there had
been happening 7 talks, all at the same time. A conference's attender had to
choose between these 7 talks every time. Unfortunately, only Spiderman can
simultaneously be everywhere at the same time, so I listened only to seven talks.

## The talks

The first talk I chose was the most interesting to me: development of a simple
Rails 3 application using Git and GitHub and deploying it to Heroku. Although I
had already known something about this topic, I still was curious to see how an
experienced programmer does it.

Unfortunately, Serhii Parizhsky, the speaker I wanted to listen to, had some
problems, so he yielded to another speaker Andriy Mykhailov, whose talk was on
Puppet. A couple of attendands, who had evidenced this, pretentiously left the
room.

To be fair, I missed a lot of information from the Puppet talk, because I was
trying to configure my photo camera. The room where we were was dark, so it
wasn't the simplest task. I remember, though, that I didn't like the style of
speech of the speaker. Although occasionally he had been trying to joke, in
general he was boring.

Fortunately, the second talk was about Rails. Initially I had planned to visit
the talk by Peter Afanasiev on "Archinecture of online payments" , but I changed
my plans, beacuse I was really eager to check out the Rails talk. That's why I
stayed in the same room.

Serhii and Sasha. Sasha announces Serhii.

This time Serhii explained that he had been experiencing issues with his
computer. From what I understood, to resolve the problem, he borrowed a laptop
from the previous speaker.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/mwXYLVt.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mwXYLVt.jpg"/></noscript>

There was installed latest version of Ubuntu on the
laptop. To my surprise Parizhsky couldn't figure out what to do with it. The
laptop's display was blocked and he was seeking for the password to unlock
it. Then he compared Gedit (which can be improved by extensions) with
Notepad. Then he was trying to find a way to create a new file in
Nautilus.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/EgXt6HY.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EgXt6HY.jpg"/></noscript>

Eventually he typed into the terminal the cherished command "rails new
appname" (I don't remember the actual name of the application). Someone from the
audience reasonably asked about what he had been doing, because everyone had
been confused. The long and the short of it is that the talk was wasted and I
was disappointed.

The third talk was about Agile software development methods. Although the
speaker, Dmytro Lapshyn, was very confident and demonstrated solid knowing of
the topic, the Agile stuff wasn't very interesting to me, because I had no
previous knowledge about it. I wanted to listen to a talk called "Designing a
web-application. Structure, clien-side and server-side", but then changed my
mind and went to this talk with Serhii, my fellow student). After the talk, some
silver-haired man came up to Dmytro with some deal. Apparently, he had been
impressed by the talk.

<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zv6GHZA.jpg"/></noscript>

The fourth talk was about leadership. Dmytro Mindra spoke about the role of a
leader in a team: why such a person is needed and what types of leaders there
exist. I enjoyed the talk, because the speaker was good, his speech was vivid
and the topic wasn't complex.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/8NtX1LS.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8NtX1LS.jpg"/></noscript>

The next, fifth talk by a Dutch specialist Naos Wilbrink was about data privacy.
The talk was completely in English.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Kd7scHS.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kd7scHS.jpg"/></noscript>

The speaker had perfect English. Every word was spoken legibly and neatly. Naos
taught us that each bit of inromation is important. He showed us that there is
an equal amount of iPhone and Android users. The talk was mercurial. The
language barrier didn't exist. The listeners asked a lot of questions. All of
the Q's received their A's.

"Crotches".

By the way, it was me who had conviced Serhii to go
with me. Initially, he wanted to listen to a talk about freelance. I think it
was the right choice. In my opinion it was the best talk.

The penultimate talk, by Yevhen Dmytrychenko, was about load testing. Yevhen
isn't an exceptionally good speaker, but his talk was decent. He spoke about
online and desktop tools for load testing and compared them to each other. I
doubt the knowledge is applicable to me, but it's still useful to know about
other things in the industry just to broaden your view.

When I was in Kharkiv I had planned which talks I want to listen. The last talk
from my list was called "Using neural networks and fuzzy logic in e-commerce". I
was prepared for this talk, as I had read a book (but not finished) on this
topic (unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the book). Much to my regret,
when I read the schedule in Odesa, I discovered that this talk was absent. They
had replaced it with another semi-self-promotional talk by Leonid Bugaev. So, I
had decided to check it out, because the other 6 talks at that time seemed to me
boring. Although his claimed topic and his actual talk were very different from
each other, I enjoyed the talk. He spoke about motivation and other abstract
tech-related things.

Rework is a nice book, but it's too abstract, just like the talk.

The talks part was over. The next part of the conference was coffee-break. I
remember there was a TV-set hanging on the wall displaying the tweets containing
the tag #itjam live. Also, for some strange reason there were easels with paper
and pens everywhere. Someone wrote a "Hello World" program in Java and someone
even managed to draw someone's portrait.

After the break there was a lottery where the prizes were tickets to various
conferences. One of those tickets was a ticket to RubyShift in Dnipropetrovsk,
which I was secretly hoping to win. I must admit that I didn't win one, but don't
tell anyone.

The next part of the conference was an interview with "big bosses" of Ukrainian
software companies. I didn't memorise their names, but I do remember that their
style of talking was all the same. It was horrific. They spoke not Russian, nor
Ukrainian, nor even English. It was a nuclear mix of all these three languages.
They are all Ukrainians (except one), so why did they do that? I can only let
some big nub from Denmark off, because he was speaking in English.

Question: "Do you use any math in your company?". Answer: "We do. We play poker!"

## Impressions and criticism

It was time to go for us. In general, the bosses' speeches were boring. There
were a lot of advertisements and other unrelated information. One of the bosses
said that they use PHP as their main language, while the majority of the
audience were Javaists. The most memorable phrase that was retweeted countless
number of times was: "The best programmers are in the USA. And... they are
Russians". Although this phrase was praised among the audience with applauses,
the author of this website strongly disagrees with it. The conference continued,
and we had to hurry up to catch a train.

I really enjoyed IT Jam. It was an interesting experience to be a visitor of
such a conference. It was also interesting to explore the city. I wouldn't mind
visiting the conference the next year. However, there were some minor
downsides. Although the conference was by Ukrainians and for Ukrainians, all the
printed information was in English. Some speakers had their slides completely in
English for no good reason. Even the conference's website was in English
*without* an option to choose the Russian or the Ukrainian language. The reason
the conference organisers decided to make everything in English is quite
obsure. What for? To brag?

The conference is over. But only for us.

On our way to the train station I decided to record a quick interview with us
about the impressions from the conference.

I also took a couple of photos of some Odesa's pearls. It's not a trip to Odesa
if you don't photograph the Potemkin Stairs.
