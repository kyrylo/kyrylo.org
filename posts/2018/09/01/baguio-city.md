Baguio is a big city in Luzon, Philippines, which is famous for its cold
weather, mountains, strawberries and... lions. Why lions? I have no idea, but
they have a huge lion head somewhere (and I didn't stumble upon it)!

One of my goals for this trip was to visit the famous strawbery fields. You get
to pick strawberries by yourself, so you buy only the freshest and most
delicious ones.

However, I came there only to discover that strawberries were not in season...

It's recommended to visit the farm from February to May. So, I had to eat the
dust instead.

On the way to the farm you pass "The Valley of Colors".

It doesn't look like anything special, though. Just a bunch of happy
houses. That said, one of the inhabitants took the name too seriously.

An immediate observation about Baguio City: their jeepneys look way better than
in Manila. They are more snazzy and better maintained. This one looks nothing
special, however it's more clean and longer.

Have I already mentioned it even has a baby TV-set?

Without planning it, I discovered that I went there excactly on Baguio City
Day. During the holiday their central street turned into a street for
pedestrians.

Not only jeepneys are cleaner here but Baguio in general is much cleaner than
Manila. This is because they keep their sorroundings clean.

They also have Clean Comfort Roomsâ„¢ all over the city (it's just a paid toilet).

It's quite amusing that you get a ticket to be able to pee. Oh, and there are
also discounts for students and senior citizens. Hot stuff!

In the night, if you climb up high enough, you can see some mysterious building
that is wery well lit and changes its colours. It turned out it was just Baguio
City Hall.

...and I found a freaking huge spider inside who was guarding its eggs! It
looked really dangerous, so I said bye-bye.

You can stumble upon some amazing plants. I don't even know the name but it
looks like the fire from a candle.

Since the city is in the mountains, it has a lot of fantatsic views. Like Mines
view.

Let's get back to the city. There's a park that speaks to you like a bro.
"Scoop your poop, you fool!".

I wonder what's the story behind this sign. The owner must be holding a grudge
against someone.

It's quite funny that playing cellphone games is a problem. So can I text all
day long instead?
