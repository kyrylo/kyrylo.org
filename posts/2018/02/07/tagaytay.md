Tagaytay
========

The main point of interest in Tagaytay, Philippines, is obviously the
Taal volcano.

The road to the volcano starts from Staalbucks.

Just kidding. The road to the volcano starts from here.

Normal folks prefer to mount a horse and pay a fee but if you have
ever met me, you wouldn't dare to say I'm one of those. I chose the
ever trusty Shanks's pony.

The benefit is that I could stop whenever I want and relish the moments of beatiful nature...

Prior to going to Taal, I didn't read anything about the place. I just
wanted to see a volcano. Namely, a crater with red burning lava! Well,
this is how it looks like in real life.

The volcano is active and you can see yellow and burnt grass.

The sand is red. Supposedly because of the heat of the volcano.

The Taal volcano rules. I was surprised to see that the Korean translation
mentions its author.
