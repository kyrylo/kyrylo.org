Bangkok
=======

<time datetime="2017-12-10">December 10, 2017 &hellip; January 9</time>

I've got a strong idea: I need to spend these winter holidays in Asia, away from
the snow and cold weather. Bangkok's capital, Thailand, was perfect for that.
<img src="https://imgur.com/CQzQBCo.jpg">

As you may know, Thais speak almost no English. I've learned "sawadee ka" & "khop
kun krap". These won't get you anywhere, unfortunately.
<img src="https://imgur.com/tb6u8TD.jpg">

The Thai abugida (alphabet) allows some nice tricks with it. The word is written
with ropes. Can you imagine the same for English?
<img src="https://imgur.com/QJHnDQ5.jpg">

Even though it's hard to navigate without knowing the language, a lot of
touristy places do have signs in English.
<img src="https://imgur.com/dvNLtPC.jpg">

Thailand cares about tourists a little bit more than your average city. They
even know what you typically would like to buy and provide you a "Tourist choice".
<img src="https://imgur.com/BseMNk6.jpg">

The MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transit) is the fastest way to get from point A to
point B. However, be aware that the staff won't let you bring your favourite
durian on the train.
<img src="https://imgur.com/qPHTbcU.jpg">

Along with the MRT, Bangkok offers a developed bus network. There are caveats,
though. Some bus stops are hard to find. A lot of them don't provide any
information about routes. Additionally, I was never able to figure out the fare:
sometimes you pay per station, sometimes the price is fixed. It was very hard to
make any sense of it.
<img src="https://imgur.com/xtpYEGk.jpg">

I have to admit, I was very impressed with the friendliness of Thai people. In
the vast majority of cases where I needed help and asked a Thai person, they
were nice to me. So if you are on a bus and don't know where to go, don't
worry, someone will help you out if you ask.

Having said that, be mindful of tuk-tuk drivers, because those people are not
nice. Every time I wanted to try a tuk-tuk, the driver's offered price was
higher than Uber's. Yes, they look flashy and cool, but their goal is to rip you
off.
<img src="https://imgur.com/p528jHA.jpg">

In a way, tuk-tuk is the jeepney of the Philippines (except that jeepney drivers
don't rip you off): they are ubiquitous.
<img src="https://imgur.com/lzywkzl.jpg">

Another viable choice to navigate the city is a plain old taxi cab. Quite often
they are even cheaper than Uber or Grab. Those guys also want to look gaudy.
<img src="https://imgur.com/mjWR2zG.jpg">

It's interesting that every cab has information about the driver. It
provides some kind of safety in case they lock you in the car and decide to
murder you.
<img src="https://imgur.com/r1MRFin.jpg">

Speaking of Uber, in Bangkok you can book UberMOTO. So, instead of cars you actually
book motorcycles. I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it makes a lot of
sense to me, because look at this damn traffic.
<img src="https://imgur.com/cqoXJm9.jpg">

Finally, you can always cycle. The prevalent majority of cyclicsts use
small-wheel bicycles. I don't know why but maybe because they need to maneuver
between cars?
<img src="https://imgur.com/v98Puvo.jpg">

Bike lanes do exist, but they are super rare.
<img src="https://imgur.com/ZlufjSB.jpg">

As for me, I was a pedestrian.
<img src="https://imgur.com/gB4Jror.jpg">

The life of a pedestrian in Bangkok is full of adventures. When I attempted to
cross a road, I had to wait for 15 minutes. Not only the traffic is heavy but
the average speed of a lane is so high that you have to run to survive.
<img src="https://imgur.com/gfWgSHT.jpg">

Quite often traffic lights are absent (or not working) and the car flow is
constant so pedestrians are blocked. You can really wait for 10 minutes. It's
not an exaggeration.
<img src="https://imgur.com/MWoQwIJ.jpg">

There are police stations here and there but I don't think they're in control
of the road situation at all.
<img src="https://imgur.com/fUT2Tmr.jpg">

Sometimes, traffic guards help out.
<img src="https://imgur.com/9nJ8buI.jpg">

One other threat that pedestrians have to deal with is rats (squint your eyes,
the rat is in the middle of the photo).
<img src="https://imgur.com/AZ8AQUV.jpg">

The bad smell from trash lying on the sidewalks attracts them.
<img src="https://imgur.com/uFSggiF.jpg">

Being an observant pedestrian, I couldn't miss an opportunity to take a picture
of someone who parks their car like an asshole. At that moment, I felt like I was
home.
<img src="https://imgur.com/YJVOCIH.jpg">

A solar powered sign. I have a few questions. Why is it off? Does it only work
when the sun is up? Why is that so? You actually need them during the night, when
there's no sun.
<img src="https://imgur.com/hUYrcLe.jpg">

The LEDs on the ground are supposed to alarm drivers of the bridge.
<img src="https://imgur.com/k7xmSVD.jpg">

Now, let's get back to tourists. Bangkok is full of them.
<img src="https://imgur.com/gHKt9w7.jpg">

I guess these guards hate them. Once in a while some cheeky bastard takes a
picture with them without their consent.
<img src="https://imgur.com/aenu0Ey.jpg">

Tourists visit nothing but touristy places so it's easy to avoid
them. This pathway is in 50 meters from Khao San Road (a super busy street), and
there's not a single person but me.
<img src="https://imgur.com/SNn8B1K.jpg">

While I'm standing there, the Khao San Road crowd feasts on insects.
<img src="https://imgur.com/vAqegWc.jpg">

"Wai!" says Ronald McDonald.
<img src="https://imgur.com/QmvRDJG.jpg">

"Ni hao" replies Mao and his friend.
<img src="https://imgur.com/vqR4fl7.jpg">

I like how nature and urbanism meet each other in Bangkok. Someone is feeding
squirrels.
<img src="https://imgur.com/XpFjToo.jpg">

Someone is feeding pigeons.
<img src="https://imgur.com/l0BFHcp.jpg">

With the exception of *the* pigeon. "Don't feed the pigeon" says the sign.
<img src="https://imgur.com/AKMWCYz.jpg">

Nobody is risking to feed freaking monitor lizards, though.
<img src="https://imgur.com/1mUs5rd.jpg">

A leaky faucet is a problem.
<img src="https://imgur.com/UCubggb.jpg">

But a leaky pipe is fine.
<img src="https://imgur.com/HyIcEoa.jpg">

Speaking of pipes, Thailand is probably the second country on Earth where you
can buy pipes for smoking drugs just on the street. The first one is likely
Afghanistan.
<img src="https://imgur.com/NhEwkEk.jpg">

Thailand loves massage. Not only you can be massaged by real people...
<img src="https://imgur.com/D7RvKHH.jpg">

...but also by machines!
<img src="https://imgur.com/eOJQEBb.jpg">

You can also check the weight of your luggage (or yourself for that matter).
<img src="https://imgur.com/QTX1Dzk.jpg">

Speaking of religion, as you know Thailand is a Buddhist country. At first, it was cool
going to a wat (temple), but it became repetitive very quickly. The
thing I noticed in Thailand is that they like to beg for money.

You are supposed to donate to monks.
<img src="https://imgur.com/E9KRRBK.jpg">

Donate to Buddha.
<img src="https://imgur.com/7UnfeRi.jpg">

Donate to the bear.
<img src="https://imgur.com/siq6DPz.jpg">

Donate, donate, donate! Donate to this urinal!
<img src="https://imgur.com/7Y7qTgi.jpg">

Just don't lose your head in this donation carnival.
<img src="https://imgur.com/fnPPAGE.jpg">

There are so many places to donate to that it's no wonder thievery is
flourishing.
<img src="https://imgur.com/UUtwEWf.jpg">

However, I think donating gold would be better because buddhists love gold.
<img src="https://imgur.com/6jCDbzE.jpg">

Thailand is a very weird country in regards to strictness. You are supposed to
take off your shoes upon entering a temple, wear proper clothes, stand up at the
cinema when they show some propaganda about their king prior to a film, but at
the same time you get ladyboys, hookers, pipes being sold on the street and
these wrist bands: the "Long live the King" band neighbours with "Mad cunt".
<img src="https://imgur.com/AURGEOJ.jpg">

My face after reading the whole board.
<img src="https://imgur.com/GMDVXIb.jpg">

Speaking of the king, they have a serious propaganda there. The king is
everywhere. He's in schools.
<img src="https://imgur.com/9eBnVW7.jpg">

In hospitals.
<img src="https://imgur.com/L2cULPF.jpg">

Even on money.
<img src="https://imgur.com/zxmQa7j.jpg">

All over the city there are people playing some sort of propaganda.
<img src="https://imgur.com/Vqv5kau.jpg">

Desipte that, to my surprise, muslims also exist in Thailand. The "Muslim prayer
room" sign.
<img src="https://imgur.com/QdzUYac.jpg">

Once in a while there will be a random monk on the street doing their chores
like topping up. They use the same streets as we, commoners, do.
<img src="https://imgur.com/HK2I0bT.jpg">

The most authentic Armani suits in Thailand (no).
<img src="https://imgur.com/Ysm95nu.jpg">

In Thailand people can still use payphones.
<img src="https://imgur.com/2IzBbEX.jpg">

A key holder at a bus stop without any keys. I wonder if bus drivers leave their keys
there because I don't mind driving a bus. Imagine a buspooling service. Cool, huh?
<img src="https://imgur.com/n1elRtC.jpg">

Free mobile charger stand.

A lot of Thai signs are amusing. Sometimes they're polite. "Please don't touch"
(an old exhibit).
<img src="https://imgur.com/RrJL04N.jpg">

Yet, in the same room there's a sign, which says "Don't you dare
to mask the air conditioner".
<img src="https://imgur.com/zbjrkjO.jpg">

"Caution! Wet floor". That's really "helpful".
<img src="https://imgur.com/J0CwCgg.jpg">

Water canals (called khlongs) pierce the flesh of the city all over.
<img src="https://imgur.com/Zi4lVGt.jpg">

In case of flooding or heavy rain the water will naturally flow inside these
channels. Make sure to have matches to send them down the stream.

Hua Lamphong railway station strongly reminded me of [Kharkiv Railway Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_railway_station).

While exploring Bangkok sometimes I felt like Lara Croft.

Stunning work of the ancients (spoiler alert: it's actually modern).
<img src="https://imgur.com/2RIbYpO.jpg">

I asked these guys to pose for me...

...but something went wrong.

I'd like to remind the reader that I was there on Christmas
time. The fact that it's Christmas is barely reflected on the
streets.
<img src="https://imgur.com/xaVUFqL.jpg">

New Year fireworks lasted only 5 minutes.
<img src="https://imgur.com/vj2WJWL.jpg">

Nevertheless, Happy New Year 2018!
