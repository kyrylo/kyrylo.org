Bangkok
=======

<time datetime="2017-12-10">December 10, 2017 &hellip; January 9</time>

I've got a strong idea: I need to spend these winter holidays in Asia, away from
the snow and cold weather. Bangkok's capital, Thailand, was perfect for that.

As you may know, Thais speak almost no English. I've learned "sawadee ka" & "khop
kun krap". These won't get you anywhere, unfortunately.
<img src="https://imgur.com/tb6u8TD.jpg">

The Thai abugida (alphabet) allows some nice tricks with it. The word is written
with ropes. Can you imagine the same for English?
<img src="https://imgur.com/QJHnDQ5.jpg">

Even though it's hard to navigate without knowing the language, a lot of
touristy places do have signs in English.

Thailand cares about tourists a little bit more than your average city. They
even know what you typically would like to buy and provide you a "Tourist choice".
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/BseMNk6.jpg">

The MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transit) is the fastest way to get from point A to
point B. However, be aware that the staff won't let you bring your favourite
durian on the train.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/qPHTbcU.jpg">

Along with the MRT, Bangkok offers a developed bus network. There are caveats,
though. Some bus stops are hard to find. A lot of them don't provide any
information about routes. Additionally, I was never able to figure out the fare:
sometimes you pay per station, sometimes the price is fixed. It was very hard to
make any sense of it.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/xtpYEGk.jpg">

I have to admit, I was very impressed with the friendliness of Thai people. In
the vast majority of cases where I needed help and asked a Thai person, they
were nice to me. So if you are on a bus and don't know where to go, don't
worry, someone will help you out if you ask.

Having said that, be mindful of tuk-tuk drivers, because those people are not
nice. Every time I wanted to try a tuk-tuk, the driver's offered price was
higher than Uber's. Yes, they look flashy and cool, but their goal is to rip you
off.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/p528jHA.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/p528jHA.jpg"></noscript>

In a way, tuk-tuk is the jeepney of the Philippines (except that jeepney drivers
don't rip you off): they are ubiquitous.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/lzywkzl.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/lzywkzl.jpg"></noscript>

Another viable choice to navigate the city is a plain old taxi cab. Quite often
they are even cheaper than Uber or Grab. Those guys also want to look gaudy.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/mjWR2zG.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/mjWR2zG.jpg"></noscript>

It's interesting that every cab has information about the driver. It
provides some kind of safety in case they lock you in the car and decide to
murder you.

Speaking of Uber, in Bangkok you can book UberMOTO. So, instead of cars you actually
book motorcycles. I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it makes a lot of
sense to me, because look at this damn traffic.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/cqoXJm9.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/cqoXJm9.jpg"></noscript>

Finally, you can always cycle. The prevalent majority of cyclicsts use
small-wheel bicycles. I don't know why but maybe because they need to maneuver
between cars?
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/v98Puvo.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/v98Puvo.jpg"></noscript>

Bike lanes do exist, but they are super rare.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/ZlufjSB.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/ZlufjSB.jpg"></noscript>

As for me, I was a pedestrian.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/gB4Jror.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/gB4Jror.jpg"></noscript>

The life of a pedestrian in Bangkok is full of adventures. When I attempted to
cross a road, I had to wait for 15 minutes. Not only the traffic is heavy but
the average speed of a lane is so high that you have to run to survive.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/gfWgSHT.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/gfWgSHT.jpg"></noscript>

Quite often traffic lights are absent (or not working) and the car flow is
constant so pedestrians are blocked. You can really wait for 10 minutes. It's
not an exaggeration.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/MWoQwIJ.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/MWoQwIJ.jpg"></noscript>

There are police stations here and there but I don't think they're in control
of the road situation at all.
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/fUT2Tmr.jpg">
<noscript><img src="https://imgur.com/fUT2Tmr.jpg"></noscript>

Sometimes, traffic guards help out.

One other threat that pedestrians have to deal with is rats (squint your eyes,
the rat is in the middle of the photo).
<img class="lazy" src="/images/i.png" data-src="https://imgur.com/AZ8AQUV.jpg">

The bad smell from trash lying on the sidewalks attracts them.

Being an observant pedestrian, I couldn't miss an opportunity to take a picture
of someone who parks their car like an asshole. At that moment, I felt like I was
home.

A solar powered sign. I have a few questions. Why is it off? Does it only work
when the sun is up? Why is that so? You actually need them during the night, when
there's no sun.

Now, let's get back to tourists. Bangkok is full of them.

I guess these guards hate them. Once in a while some cheeky bastard takes a
picture with them without their consent.

Tourists visit nothing but touristy places so it's easy to avoid
them. This pathway is in 50 meters from Khao San Road (a super busy street), and
there's not a single person but me.

With the exception of *the* pigeon. "Don't feed the pigeon" says the sign.

Speaking of pipes, Thailand is probably the second country on Earth where you
can buy pipes for smoking drugs just on the street. The first one is likely
Afghanistan.

Speaking of religion, as you know Thailand is a Buddhist country. At first, it was cool
going to a wat (temple), but it became repetitive very quickly. The
thing I noticed in Thailand is that they like to beg for money.

You are supposed to donate to monks.

However, I think donating gold would be better because buddhists love gold.

Thailand is a very weird country in regards to strictness. You are supposed to
take off your shoes upon entering a temple, wear proper clothes, stand up at the
cinema when they show some propaganda about their king prior to a film, but at
the same time you get ladyboys, hookers, pipes being sold on the street and
these wrist bands: the "Long live the King" band neighbours with "Mad cunt".
