Dubai
=====

<p class="post__date"><time datetime="2021-02-24">February 24, 2021&ndash;March 5, 2021</time></p>

Prior to going to Dubai, I already had certain expectations. That said, I didn’t
expect that my first experience would be falling for a scam. Well, kind of. You
see, as a Ukrainian citizen, I can visit the UAE without a visa. However, I was
dumb enough to pay some agency to provide me with a tourist visa. When I had
paid them the full amount, I realised that was a mistake. When I asked for a
refund (30 minutes after my payment), they refused.

Alas, that’s the price I had to pay for being careless. I was able to enter the
UAE with a visa that nobody even checked.

Let's start. Dubai is the land of cars.

When you are a pedestrian in this city, it's considered a mishap. When you are a
pedestrian, you wait. No, you WAIT.

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6VHsGBh.jpg"></figure>

If you don't want to WAIT, you may go. Just don't expect this experience to be
safe or pleasant. Sometimes there are no sidewalks in Dubai.

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YyXsuSj.jpg"></figure>

So, if you don't want to take a taxi, don't expect that it'll be free
either. Dubai forces you to pay. The more, the better. The fine for jaywalking
here is 400 dirhams (about $110).

Without a way to cross the road, without a safe sidewalk, a daily routine such
as going to the grocery store turns into a suicide mission that you'll have to
fund if the police catches you.

Although I am a daring individual, I would not go beneath an overpass for no
apparent reason. I found myself there looking for a method to go around this
juncture. There was no such thing, as it turned out. A kilometer away was the
nearest crossing (not just a safe crossing, but any crossing).

You have no chance against this concrete jungle, even if you wish to take a
gamble and run for your life while evading rapid cars.

Some of the crossings are not that safe. Take a look at how broad this junction
is. You can easily erect another skyscraper here.

This particular crossing has a tiny pedestrian island. I wouldn't feel
comfortable there waiting for my green light.

Basically, everyone here screams that you're not welcome when you transport
yourself using something other than a wheel.

It's really surprising to me that walking in Dubai is tough. I can clearly see
that the city invests in public transportation. Walking and public
transportation go together (or walk together?). Dubai offers multiple ways of
budget traveling. One is renting a bicycle. I was eager to try it out, but I
couldn't because I didn't have mobile data when I was on the street. In order to
rent a bicycle, you need an app and an internet connection.

Cycling infrastructure does exist in Dubai, but it's not connected together. The
bicycle lanes here end abruptly, and you are forced to yield to cars.

As a result, not many choose to cycle.

Those who do prefer cycling might even have no infrastructure whatsoever.

If you don't yield to a car, you might bump into a road worker's middle finger
in the form of pavement construction.

In other cases, the cycling infrastructure is there, but the cyclists have not
yet been born in that area. And to be perfectly honest, some paint on the ground
is not cycling infrastructure.

Anyway, enough of the cycling. You can take a tram in Dubai.

The only problem is that the coverage is rather poor. The tracks start from
nowhere and lead to nowhere.

A much better alternative would be the Dubai Metro, a fast and completely
autonomous railway system covering all key destinations in the city.

Every station looks identical (unlike in my city, where every station must have a
personality).

The metro is also completely safe. There's no way to fall on the tracks. What I
love about it is that everything is automated. What I don't love is that there
are separate coaches for women and men. Women can go inside coaches for men, but
men are not allowed to go to the women's place.

I also am not a fan of strict rules like no eating or drinking, or even chewing
gum.

No chewing gum yadda-yadda, very dangerous yadda-yadda, can cause a trainwreck
yadda.

Those four birds that are not following the leader clearly didn't obtain their
flying license legally. I don't think flying like that is okay in the UAE. Does
anyone know how many dirhams the fine is for that violation? And also, if they
chewed bubble gum, that amount would probably be doubled.

In general, most of Dubai's life finds itself on Sheikh Zayed Road. The cars and
the trains make this experience quite noisy. Even with your windows closed.

Speaking of penalties, the signs informing us what's not allowed are
everywhere. I actually think some of them make sense, like this "red light
violation" rule. However, given the technological advances Dubai has made, I
think it's a rather poor attempt. We can install such a sign here in Ukraine,
but it won't do any good. Dubai, with trillions of dollars, can develop a more
advanced solution. An automated system that imposes certain rules on everybody
would be perfect. The little human interaction, the better. Anyway, I'm not
gonna solve it for you, Dubai (unless you share with me some of your
petrodollars).

If you do speed, you have no chance against the police here. By using muscle
cars, they can chase anyone without breaking a drop of sweat.

sliding doors and air conditioning.

However, at a bus terminal, the stops were rather inconvenient & uninformative,
providing only a little bit of shadow.

using wheelchairs in Dubai, though.

At some metro stations, I saw a hi from the past: a payphone. In order to use
this particular exhibit, you would need to bring some change and also wire up
your own telephone handset (inserting the ends of the wires directly into your
ears can be tried but is not recommended).

While most of the things you see in these pictures are brand new, this lamp post
is not. I'm sure it's new as well, but it tries to look vintage, which makes it
look out of place.

Similarly to the Philippines, the rear side of trucks mentions a number to call
in case the driver goes bananas on the road.

available in town. The service can be Russian, Turkish, or Pakistani. Hmmmm...

Basically, closer to the evening time, there's someone who sows the unfertile
soil of Dubai with these pamphlets. I was surprised to see something like that
in a place that is protected by Sharia law.

Most of the time, the streets of Dubai look deserted. Wide highways and large
distances between buildings with no people walking make it hard to believe that
the city is home to 3.3 million inhabitants.

If you are from a hot climate country, or maybe you've been to such a country,
you might take a guess and say that during the day there's nobody on the streets
because everybody is inside malls. Well, that's a witty observation. Let's take
a gander at one of the malls during lunchtime.

That's not an accident. According to my personal perception, 1/3 of the country
speaks Filipino. No matter where you go, Filipinos will be working there. It was
fun to practice my Tagalog once again and surprise a few folks. "Kabayan" in
Tagalog means "fellow citizen".

Usually, the Catholic churches I've been to look very nice both inside and
outside. This one has a 3-meter concrete wall, which can withstand a direct hit
from a modern tank, and 3-meter screens to catch all incoming grenades. Do they
do masses there or mass shootings? What are they hiding there? Or is it to
protect them from the outside? There are too many questions for a church.

Filipinos do love their pork. I think that's why in certain supermarkets there
is a pork section. The sign says "for non-Muslims," but it should really say

A lot of money is wasted on these green pastures. What's the point? Nobody walks
here, people who drive don't care that much.

Moreover, to keep it green, you have to waste the most precious resource on
our planet, water.

I also don't see any cows around. Who knows, they might convert that into a cow
field and produce some Dubalpine milk.

Dubai isn't a new city but it still lacks history. They tried to build
"historical" places, but they look too modern.

I love the idea of donating old or unused clothes. We don't have such boxes in
Ukraine, so I just donate some of my clothes to people I know. If we had these
boxes, I would do that much more frequently.

I heard the Dubai Mall is the biggest in the world. I don't know if that still
remains true, but I do know that it's a clever idea to denote what language
every staff member can speak.

Being the biggest mall in the world doesn't guarantee the largest number of
visitors. It was relatively empty.

I don't blame people. In order to get here, you need to ride the metro. When
you're at the station, it's a 15-minute walk through an overpass tunnel going
straight to the mall. Yes, there are conveyor belts to speed this up, but even
with them, it's a very uncomfortable experience because there's not much to look
at.

I think people would happily use golf carts or electric scooters in order to get
to the mall or back to the metro station. That's a free business idea for you,
Dubai.

outside, spend the whole day, and come back home wearing completely clean shoes
is pure bliss. This is something that's practically non-existent in my country.

The gap between the rich and the poor is very evident in the UAE. I had thought
that everybody in Dubai swims in luxury. It turned out that only some people
really do swim in luxury. They swim their yachts.

Unfortunately, similarly to many Asian megalopolises, you have to use
overpasses. At least in Dubai, all of them have working elevators.
