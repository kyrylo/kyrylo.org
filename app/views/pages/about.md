title: About? The site history instead of the about!
---

It's quite amusing: although this site was launched in 2014, its story has
started a long time ago. I came up with the very first version in 2010. Well, it
wasn't a real website. Back then it was just a simple HTML page with an image in
the header. I've had so many versions of my personal website that I lost its
count.  Each year, between 2010 and 2014, I had been announcing that I plan to
release my website. However, due to my perfectionism I had been failing every
time. I had been caring for compatibility with Internet Explorer, perfect code,
100% test coverage, pixel-hunting and other unimportant things. The key point I
had been missing is that a website isn't about the design, but about the
content.

## 2010

[The first version](/prototype2010/index.html) is dated on the 11th of
January 2010. The site's headline was "Kyrylo Silin: internet and life.", with a
full stop in the end. I really had no idea why I wanted a website. The next
version has appeared during the same year and it was even more simple. I don't
have a graphical evidence, though.

<div class="caption">The only page of the site</div>
</div>

## 2011

On the 8th of August in 2011 I to created a new version. This time the headline
was "Kyrylo Silin: not merely super", with the full stop, again. The screenshot
below demonstrates one of the variants of the design. I remember that I had been
working during the hot summer nights and been experimenting with the layout a
lot.

<div class="figure center">
<img src="/images/website2011.png" style="width: 66%"/>
<div class="caption">The index page</div>
</div>

What's interesting is that the 2011 version was way more funky. This is the
introduction page that precedes the index page.

<div class="figure center">
<img src="/images/website2011-entrance.png" style="width: 50%"/>
<div class="caption">Introduction</div>
</div>

The greeting has already had some strange flavour of surrealism, and when you
fill out the password form, you unlock "different versions" of the website. To
be honest, I can't explain what I meant anymore. All I can tell you is
thank goodness you don't understand Russian.

<div class="figure center">
<img src="/images/website2011-password.png" style="width: 50%"/>
<div class="caption">Unlocked "versions"</div>
</div>

One notable thing about that form is how the transition of the password
confirmation is done.

<div class="caption">I'm proud of this effect :)</div>
</div>

## 2012

This version hasn't lost its funkiness. A glance at the photos is enough to tell
that it still has its strange charm. The headline says "Only Black and White",
_without_ the full stop. Today's website is based on the ideas from 2012.

## 2013

I started working on the 2013 version in December. I had decided to release the
website on the 31th of December as a New Year's present to myself. I
failed. This version is more mature and doesn't have any weird content except
the black pyramid. The prototype page is available
[online](/prototype2013/index.html).

<div class="figure center">
<img src="/images/website2013.png"/>
<div class="caption">The prototype of the home page</div>
</div>

So the next milestone was my birthday, the 25th of February, which already
was 2014. I was _very_ intent. I had been working hard to implement my project
and...

## 2014

I failed. Again. I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the 2013 version, so I
redesigned it from the top to the bottom. This time I polished everything I
could. I must mention that I have had two versions of this design. The timeline
has received a lot of my attention and efforts. For the bigger resolutions you
can right-click on an image and open it in a new tab.

<div class="fotorama" data-height="600">
	 <img src="images/website2014-index.png"/>
	 <img src="images/website2014-projects.png"/>
	 <img src="images/website2014-project.png"/>
	 </div>

So when I started programming it, I realised that it's too complex for a personal
website. I couldn't be bothered implementing everything I designed.

## 2014 and later on

Welcome, you're viewing the modern version. I decided to take the layout of the
2014 version and simplify everything inside. The modern version takes a lot of
ideas from all its predecessors. The path that I walked has been very long and
painful.

## The real about

In this section I probably need to explain what "Only Black and White" actually
means and why the site's logo is that cube. The headline refers to my character
and how I perceive this world. It seems like I can see only the black and the
white tones. However, the cube with the rainbow inside shows that it's not
quite true. Between the black and the white you can observe a lot of interesting
information and feelings. The combination of colours, vertices and edges form an
arrow, which refers to the constant self-development.
