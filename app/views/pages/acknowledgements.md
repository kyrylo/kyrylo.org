I want to thank everyone who allowed me to use their work both directly (by
personal consent) or indirectly (by means of a non-restricting licence). This
includes software, third-party libraries, fonts images and any other

However, I'd like to personally thank these people:

* Alexey \<[gas13](http://gas13.ru/en_index.php)\> Garkushin --- for my avatar
* Ivan \<[Jovanny Lemonad](http://jovanny.ru/)\> Gladkikh --- for the Oranienbaum
font

I also would like to thank the people that played a significant role in my life:

* My family
* Alexander Barkov
* [Conrad Irwin](http://cirw.in/)
* Mikhail Fedak
* Vladislav Sypchenko
* [Simon Maynard](http://snmaynard.com/)

All the lists are in the alphabetical order.
