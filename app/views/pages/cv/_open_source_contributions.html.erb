    I am a core team member of the Pry REPL project for the Ruby programming
    language and some of its auxiliary projects like
    <%= link_to 'Pry Doc', 'https://github.com/pry/pry-doc' %>,
    <%= link_to 'Interception', 'https://github.com/ConradIrwin/interception' %>
    and others. I&#8217;ve also contributed to the website, the wiki, the IRC
    channel and in any other possible way. I&#8217;ve been spreading Pry
    stickers at Ruby conferences and meetups.
