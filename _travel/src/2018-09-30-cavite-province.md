Cavite is a big province in Luzon, Philippines. During this trip, I was lucky enough to visit Bacoor, Maragondon, and Kawit.

Somehow, Maragondon gave me Ukrainian vibes (check the flags).

The main point of interest in Maragondon is Bonifacio Shrine. The road to it is sinuous and thorny.

If you find yourself vulnerable, lost, and stuck...

...just ask some local cows for directions.

The shrine itself was actually abandoned.

The official way to enter its territory was through a window in the booth by the gate. Because of this, wildlife was prospering. I'm not lying, there were absolutely no people there and the entrance was blocked.

Another point of interest in Cavite is Emilio Aguinaldo Shrine (it's an antique house), which is in the city of Kawit. This time, the road was easy because there were many beefed-up jeepneys cruising the city.

I kid you not, it's the best house I've been to. Kuya Vener Vales, the guide, was kind enough to show me some secret passages inside the house and share fascinating stories about the history of the place. He's been the guide there for decades and has even witnessed Emilio Aguinaldo himself.

Unfortunately, lady History preferred not to reveal pictures of the shrine. Here's a picture of a Kawit church during a mass, instead.
